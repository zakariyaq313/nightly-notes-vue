A notes-app inspired by Google Keep - made using Vue. There is also an [alternate version](https://github.com/zakariyaq313/nightly-notes-react) using React.

**Notes -**

I always liked the simple and minimalistic design of Google Keep, and long hoped to create an application similar to it. I worked with Vue at my job, but never really got around to creating any personal project using it. So for my first app with Vue, I decided to create this notes-app. It was a great learning experience for me, and I'm satisfied with the result. I do have some improvements planned for the future, if and when I get some free time :)

I have added a little info on the app's design progression [here](./src/README.md).
