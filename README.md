**Notes -**

I've always liked the simple and minimalistic design of Google Keep, and wanted to create an application that resembles it. I worked with Vue at my job, but didn't have any personal project made using it. So for my first project with Vue, I decided to create a notes app. This was a great learning experience for me, and I'm satisfied with the result. I do have some improvements planned for the future, if and when I get some free time :)

I have added a little info on the app design's progression [here](./src/README.md).
